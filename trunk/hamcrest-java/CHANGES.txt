== Version 1.2: In Development ==

* Added IsMapContainingKey and IsMapContainingValue matchers to resolve a 
  generics bug in hasKey and hasValue static factories previously declared
  in IsMapContaining (ngd)

* Added IsCollectionOnlyContaining and IsArrayOnlyContaining which matches 
  collections (and arrays) where all match a given matcher. E.g onlyContains(3,4,5) 
  or onlyContains(lessThan(9))

== Version 1.1: Released Jun 30 2007 ==

* Hamcrest Generator now includes JavaDoc and parameter names in generated code
  by using QDox to parse the source code.

* Created hamcrest-core.jar (and removed hamcrest-api.jar).
  Moved core set of matchers (and, eq, not, etc)
  to this package to make it more practical for external libraries
  to embed Hamcrest.

* Created CoreMatchers (static import sugar) in hamcrest-core.jar.

* StringBuilder can use any Appendable (not just StringBuffer).

* Added sensible toString() method to BaseMatcher.

* Created StringDescription.asString() alias (because toString() caused issues
  with static imports).

* Relaxed isInstanceOf() matcher generic type so it can be used on any kind of
  object. e.g. assertThat(someUnknownObject, isInstanceOf(String.class));

* Added any(Class<T>), null(Class<T>) and notNull(Class<T>) matchers, which returns
  Matcher<T>. Helpful when the compiler struggles with type inference.

* Modified anyOf() and allOf() to accept mixed-types.

* TypeSafeMatcher.matchesSafely() is now public.

* Generator recognizes @Factory methods that return subclass of Matcher.
